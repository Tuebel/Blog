Back in the days, I worked through the [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) resources to learn about neural networks for computer vision.
[Jeremy Howard](https://jeremy.fast.ai/) stated somewhere that everyone should have a personal blog or website.
They also offered a nice GitHub template called [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages) which made it too easy.
Write some Markdown, the GitHub pipelines were ready to go, and boom, there was a github.io page.

Compared to the quirky website builders on some shady website I used during school, I somehow owned the website. 
And this feeling of wanting to own my little home in the interwebs was sparked again when I joined the Fediverse on Mastodon.
My [fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/@tuebel) instance is clearly biased towards a personal website, and the enthusiasm grabbed.
Pointing people to my short [redick.cc] domain vs. sharing my LinkedIn or Facebook profile is just so much smoother.
To be honest, I also was a little jealous of my friend, who has a super short email address.
So I went and bought my domain, which is cheaper for a whole year than almost any streaming service for a year.
I cleaned up the deprecated fastpages template to a minimal Jekyll setup, which builds again, and found my little home in the WWW.
