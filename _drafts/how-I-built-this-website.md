- Cloudflare: Good prices for domain, nice additional services like mail forwarding, hosting pages, mail obfuscation
- Jekyll: I like the simplicity of markdown (also use Logseq) and this builds static pages from it
- Zoho: Wanted to answer using my domain instead of the forwared email. Is free for 5 persons, might switch to a more privacy focused mail service. These cost too much when scaling to multiple persons.
